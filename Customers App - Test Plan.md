### General Notes

- For the purposes of testing, I assumed that the tester has access to a database where he can register new accounts
- I found one defect at the requirements review stage - in 'Customer List Screen' section it's incorrectly written that 'Small' size of company is set when # of Employees is 'less than or equal **100**'.
- I have not found anything about welcome message on the 'Customer List Screen' in the requirements, thus I did not cover that functionality (including showing timestamp) in the test plan. It needs to be clarified with the PO before it's classified as a non-compliance with the requirements.
- I focused on functional testing based on requirements. Additional non-functional (e.g. security) might be considered at least at some basic level.
